# PBL5
This is a Project Based Learning (PBL) project. It is a sign language recognition system which is still being worked on to detect sign language. The future plans for this project is to implement body pose and expression using mediaPipe holistic, not detect body signs and expressions. 

This is done because a single sign made by the hand can have different meanings but can also be differentiated by the location of the hand. Example is the sign for mother and father which both have the same sign but can be differentiated by the location of the hand's placement.
