# PBL5
This is a Project Based Learning (PBL) project. It is a sign language recognition system which is still being worked on to detect sign language. One of the code belongs to a senior of mine who started this project. I modified it and now plan to add more to it. The difference between our code is that his own contains predetermined words that are in the code. So there are words or label in the code that records the data, but mine is flexible, meaning we can put any word or label before recording the code. The future plans for this project is to implement body pose and expression using mediaPipe holistic, not detect body signs and expressions. 

This is done because a single sign made by the hand can have different meanings but can also be differentiated by the location of the hand. Example is the sign for mother and father which both have the same sign but can be differentiated by the location of the hand's placement.
